// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Add two numbers
Get two numbers
Name first number Var1
Name second number Var2
Add Var1 to Var2 
	(Var1 + Var2)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Get number 
	Name Var4
Divide Var4 by 2
	(Var4/2)
If Var4 = int then print “Even”
If Var4 = float then print “Odd”


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Read in numbers 1,2,3,4,5
Get average
Average = ((1+2+3+4+5)/5)
Get smallest and largest
	Read in 2 numbers 
		If 2 > 1 set Max to 2 and Min to 1
		If 3 > 2 set Max to 3 keep Min 1
		If 4 > 3 set Max to 4 keep Min 1
		If 5 > 4 set Max to 5 keep min 1
Print results
	Print “Average”
	Print “Min” and “Max”
